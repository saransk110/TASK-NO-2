Difference beetween Document and Window objects:

WINDOW OBJECT:
a window object represents a single tab, but some of its properties like innerHeight, innerWidth and 
methods like resizeTo() will affect the whole browser window.

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document

DOCUMENT OBJECT:
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. 
The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD,
 BODY, and other HTML tags).
 It is the root element that represents the html document.

where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object
directly as window is global object.
